We study six pedal-like curves associated with the ellipse  which are area-invariant for pedal points lying on one of two shapes: (i) a circle concentric with the ellipse, or (ii) the ellipse boundary itself. Case (i) is a corollary of properties of Steiner's Curvature Centroid (Kr√ºmmungs-Schwerpunkt), proved in 1825. For case (ii) we prove area invariance algebraically. Explicit expressions for all invariant areas are also provided. Finally, we generalize the results for a class of smooth curves.
